"""Branch scoping for the cleanup-pr command (FR-4 issue selection, FR-5 duplication selection).

Glue that maps ``IssueLineFilter`` output (``ReviewIssue`` objects) back to
the ``SonarQubeIssue`` records that produced it, so the fixer works on full
issue objects (key, status, ...) instead of the filtered report views, and
that selects the duplication groups whose target block intersects the branch's
strict changed lines — the same active-duplication rule ``review`` applies.
