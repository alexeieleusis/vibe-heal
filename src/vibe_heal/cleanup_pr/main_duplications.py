"""Main-duplication detection helpers for the cleanup-pr command (FR-6).

A *main duplication* is a duplication block that existed in the base branch, was
modified or removed by the branch, and is no longer active in the branch
(``ResolvedDuplication``). This module reads the main-side text and the
branch-side hunk from git and builds the AI prompt and commit message for one
qualifying group. Detection itself reuses ``review.duplication_scope``; the
orchestration (ordering, counters, failure policy) lives in ``orchestrator.py``.
